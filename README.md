# Number Guessing Game  

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built in Python where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game offers three difficulty levels:  

- **Easy (10 chances)**  
- **Medium (5 chances)** 
- **Hard (3 chances)**  

### How It Works:  
1. The computer selects a random number.  
2. The player chooses a difficulty level, which determines the number of attempts.  
3. For each guess, the game provides feedback ("higher" or "lower") to help the player narrow down the correct number.  
4. The game ends if the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.  

This project is a great way to practice Python basics, including loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
